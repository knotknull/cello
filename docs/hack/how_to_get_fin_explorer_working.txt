After massive amount of mucking around with the app/platform/fabric/config.json file, here is how I finally got it to work.


1.  Copied the following composer file as config.json

ubuntu@hackfab001:

cp /opt/fabric/hack_fab_bc/.composer/cards/ccpAdmin@derivhack-network/connection.json   ~/blockchain-explorer/app/platform/fabric/config.json


NOTE:  had to run it thru a JSON formatter at https://duckduckgo.com/?q=json+formatter&t=ffab&ia=answer  first


2.  Add the following as the first two lines

from :
{                                                              
  "name": "ccp-network",
  "x-type": "hlfv1",   
to :
 
{
  "network-configs": {
  "name": "ccp-network",
  "x-type": "hlfv1",


3. To match out the newly added top right paren "{"
add the folloing to the bottom "}"


  },
  "channel": "firstchannel",
  "orderers": [
    {
      "mspid": "ord",
      "server-hostname": "orderer1-ord",
      "requests": "grpcs://orderer1-ord:7050",
      "tls_cacerts": "/opt/fabric/hack_fab_bc/run/keyfiles/ord/orderers/orderer1-ord.ord/tls/ca.crt"
    }
  ],
  "keyValueStore": "/tmp/fabric-client-kvs",
  "configtxgenToolPath": "/opt/fabric/bin",
  "SYNC_START_DATE_FORMAT": "YYYY/MM/DD",
  "syncStartDate": "2018/01/01",
  "eventWaitTime": "30000",
  "license": "Apache-2.0",
  "version": "1.1"
}

  




Try to put config.json in docker part and see if you can get it run via docker.

Need to update the perm file locations to be loaded from -v /opt/fabric/run/keyfiles ...
